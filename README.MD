# END TO END MOVIE GENRE MACHINE LERANING CODE
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre(s) of a movie based on its textual metadata (such as plot summary, cast, crew, etc.). The goal is to create a scalable solution that automates genre tagging for movies, aiding in content recommendation systems and genre-based content organization. The model should handle multi-label classification, as movies can belong to multiple genres simultaneously. The system should be efficient, capable of processing large datasets efficiently, and provide interpretable genre predictions to enhance user experience in movie platforms.
